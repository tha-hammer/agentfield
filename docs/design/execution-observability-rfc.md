## 1. Summary

This RFC proposes a new execution-observability model for Silmari where the execution detail page becomes the primary debugging surface for live and recent execution behavior.

The model separates observability into three distinct layers:

1. **Execution logs**: structured, execution-correlated logs stamped by the SDK/runtime and surfaced as the primary log stream on the execution page.
2. **Lifecycle events**: control-plane execution and workflow events that anchor the execution timeline.
3. **Raw node logs**: process-level stdout/stderr logs exposed as an advanced debug surface for deeper inspection.

The key design decision is that **execution logs are the primary product surface**, while raw node logs remain available but clearly secondary. This gives users a useful, filterable, execution-scoped debugging experience without pretending that raw process logs are perfectly attributable to a single execution.

---

## 2. Product Intent

### 2.1 Main Product Goal

When a user opens an execution detail page, they should be able to answer:

- What happened during this execution?
- What node or reasoner produced each log line?
- What is happening right now if the execution is still live?
- What failed, where, and with what context?

### 2.2 Product Decisions Confirmed

This RFC reflects the following product decisions:

- **Execution logs are primary** on the execution page.
- **Raw node logs are behind advanced/debug UI** rather than front-and-center.
- **Control-plane lifecycle events are included**, but raw control-plane server logs are not in scope for v1.
- **Multi-node log rendering is chronological by default**.
- **Filtering by node, source, level, and text is required**.
- **Live streaming plus short retention** is the preferred operating model.
- **SDKs should expose a developer logger API and auto-generate runtime/system logs**.
- **Structured execution logs should also appear in stdout** for local developer ergonomics.
- **Fast rollout with partial coverage is acceptable**, but the architecture must preserve a path to stronger correlation and filtering.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

PR #330 adds node-level process log proxying and UI panels. That solves a real gap, but it does not solve execution-level observability.

Today, the system has two disjoint observability channels:

- **Durable execution/workflow events** in the control plane
- **Raw node/process logs** exposed by agents

These channels answer different questions:

- Lifecycle events explain **state transitions**
- Raw node logs explain **process behavior**

The missing piece is a structured execution-correlated log stream that can be safely rendered on an execution page and filtered in a useful way.

### 3.1 Why Raw Node Logs Alone Are Not Enough

Raw node logs are process-scoped, not execution-scoped.

If a node handles multiple executions concurrently:

- stdout/stderr lines can interleave
- lines may not be attributable to one execution
- filtering by execution becomes impossible unless the runtime stamps correlation metadata at emission time

This is the central architectural constraint.

---

## 4. Proposed User Experience

### 4.1 Execution Detail Page

The execution page should expose three distinct observability areas:

1. **Timeline**
   - execution started
   - node invoked
   - waiting / retried / failed / succeeded
   - powered by control-plane lifecycle and workflow events

2. **Execution Logs**
   - primary log stream
   - structured, execution-correlated
   - chronological
   - filterable by:
     - level
     - node
     - source
     - text query
     - system vs developer logs
   - supports:
     - live mode
     - paused mode
     - reconnect state
     - short-tail load

3. **Advanced Debug**
   - raw node logs
   - hidden behind an advanced/debug affordance
   - clearly labeled as process-level logs that may include unrelated node activity

### 4.2 Multi-Node Behavior

For v1, logs render in **strict chronological order**.

Each row should still visibly show:

- timestamp
- level
- node
- reasoner or source
- message

This preserves chronological readability while still making multi-node traffic understandable.

### 4.3 Live Mode

The logs component should behave similarly to node logs:

- collapsed or hidden by default if desired by page layout
- user opts into live mode
- connection indicator:
  - connected
  - reconnecting
  - disconnected
- tail fetch when opening
- live stream when enabled

---

## 5. Observability Model

### 5.1 Layer 1: Lifecycle Events

These are existing control-plane and workflow events:

- execution started
- execution waiting
- execution paused
- execution resumed
- execution cancelled
- execution failed
- execution completed
- workflow execution events emitted by SDK/runtime during local or nested execution paths

These anchor the timeline and should remain semantically distinct from logs.

### 5.2 Layer 2: Structured Execution Logs

These are new or newly formalized records emitted by the SDK/runtime and correlated to an execution.

They are the **main product surface** for debugging.

Characteristics:

- structured JSONL / NDJSON event envelope
- stamped with execution context
- live stream capable
- short retention
- stored or indexed in the control plane
- optimized for filtering and chronological rendering

### 5.3 Layer 3: Raw Node Logs

These remain:

- process-level stdout/stderr logs
- proxied from node to control plane UI
- useful for advanced debugging
- not reliable as the primary execution-correlation mechanism

Raw node logs should remain available because:

- some applications will still use plain stdout
- developers need local ergonomics
- production debugging often needs the raw stream

But they should not be presented as the canonical execution log model.

---

## 6. Canonical Structured Log Envelope

### 6.1 Required Fields

Each structured execution log record should include:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "ts": "2026-04-06T10:15:30.123Z",
  "execution_id": "exec_123",
  "workflow_id": "wf_123",
  "run_id": "run_123",
  "root_workflow_id": "wf_root_123",
  "parent_execution_id": "exec_parent_1",
  "agent_node_id": "claims-processor",
  "reasoner_id": "validate_claim",
  "level": "info",
  "source": "sdk.runtime",
  "event_type": "reasoner.started",
  "message": "Reasoner execution started",
  "attributes": {
    "sdk_language": "typescript",
    "input_size_bytes": 1420
  },
  "system_generated": true
}
```

Required top-level fields:

- `v`
- `ts`
- `execution_id`
- `workflow_id`
- `run_id`
- `agent_node_id`
- `level`
- `source`
- `message`

Strongly recommended:

- `root_workflow_id`
- `parent_execution_id`
- `reasoner_id`
- `event_type`
- `attributes`
- `system_generated`

### 6.2 Optional Fields

Optional fields for richer filtering and future compatibility:

- `attempt`
- `span_id`
- `step_id`
- `error_category`
- `sdk_language`
- `call_target`
- `transport`
- `request_id`

### 6.3 Level Semantics

Canonical levels:

- `debug`
- `info`
- `warn`
- `error`

Avoid runtime-specific level drift at the ingestion boundary.

### 6.4 Source Semantics

Source should identify who emitted the log:

- `sdk.runtime`
- `sdk.logger`
- `user.app`
- `control-plane.lifecycle`

For v1, `control-plane.lifecycle` can remain modeled as timeline events rather than entering the log store if that simplifies rollout.

---

## 7. SDK and Runtime Responsibilities

### 7.1 Hard Requirement

The SDK/runtime must stamp structured logs with the active execution context.

This is not optional. It is the only way to provide reliable execution-level observability.

### 7.2 Developer Logger API

Each SDK should expose an execution-aware logger API from the current context.

Examples:

```typescript
ctx.logger.info("Fetched customer profile", { customer_id: customerId });
ctx.logger.error("Tool call failed", { tool_name: "crm_lookup", retryable: true });
```

```python
app.ctx.logger.info("Fetched customer profile", customer_id=customer_id)
app.ctx.logger.error("Tool call failed", tool_name="crm_lookup", retryable=True)
```

```go
ctx.Logger().Info("Fetched customer profile", map[string]any{"customer_id": customerID})
ctx.Logger().Error("Tool call failed", map[string]any{"tool_name": "crm_lookup"})
```

Desired behavior:

- automatically enrich from current execution context
- accept structured attributes
- support common levels
- safe no-op or degraded behavior if execution context is unavailable

### 7.3 Automatic Runtime/System Logs

SDKs should also emit system-generated logs for key runtime transitions:

- reasoner started
- reasoner completed
- reasoner failed
- local child call started
- local child call completed
- downstream agent call started
- downstream agent call completed
- downstream agent call failed
- retry scheduled
- approval wait entered
- approval resolved
- transport timeout

This ensures v1 utility even before all application developers adopt the explicit logger API.

### 7.4 Stdout Mirroring

Structured execution logs should also appear in stdout for local developer ergonomics.

Recommended behavior:

- **Dev mode**: mirror structured logs to stdout by default
- **Production**: configurable

This allows local developers to continue using familiar terminal workflows without making stdout the canonical system of record.

### 7.5 Execution Context Propagation

The SDK audit should ensure that the following fields are propagated consistently:

- `execution_id`
- `workflow_id`
- `run_id`
- `parent_execution_id`
- `parent_workflow_id`
- `root_workflow_id`
- `agent_node_id`
- `reasoner_id`

Known implication:

- any path that emits logs without a current execution context must clearly degrade to node-level logging only

---

## 8. Storage and Transport Model

### 8.1 Transport

Use NDJSON / JSONL as the wire and storage format for structured execution logs.

Why:

- stream-friendly
- append-friendly
- compatible with live tailing
- already aligned with current node log patterns

### 8.2 Ingestion Model

The control plane should expose a structured execution-log ingestion path separate from raw node log proxying.

Possible v1 design:

- SDK/runtime emits structured execution logs to control plane over authenticated HTTP
- control plane appends them to a short-retention store keyed by execution
- control plane exposes:
  - tail fetch endpoint
  - live stream endpoint

This is preferable to scraping or reconstructing execution logs from stdout.

### 8.3 Retention

V1 should optimize for **live plus short retention**.

Suggested configurable controls:

- max log events per execution
- max bytes per execution
- retention duration
- live stream timeout
- default tail size

Retention should be exposed through settings, similar in spirit to node log proxy settings.

### 8.4 Query Shape

Execution logs should support queries by:

- `execution_id`
- `workflow_id`
- `agent_node_id`
- `level`
- `source`
- time window
- text search

Chronological order should be the default sort.

---

## 9. Control Plane Responsibilities

### 9.1 Timeline vs Logs

The control plane should preserve the semantic distinction:

- lifecycle and workflow events are for the timeline
- structured execution logs are for the logs surface
- raw node logs remain advanced debug

### 9.2 UI Requirements

Execution page logs component should support:

- initial tail fetch
- live mode
- reconnect state
- pause/resume live updates
- filters:
  - level
  - node
  - source
  - free-text
  - developer vs system logs
- clear visual treatment of:
  - lifecycle event
  - structured execution log
  - raw node log

### 9.3 Advanced Debug Surface

Raw node logs should:

- live under an advanced/debug affordance
- allow choosing the relevant node
- optionally constrain by recent time window or tail
- carry clear messaging that they are process-level and may include unrelated activity

---

## 10. Settings

The system should expose configuration for structured execution logs similarly to current node log settings.

Suggested settings:

- execution log retention duration
- max events per execution
- max bytes per execution
- live stream idle timeout
- default tail size
- stdout mirroring enabled
- system log emission enabled

Separate settings should remain for raw node logs.

---

## 11. Rollout Strategy

- add advanced raw node logs view

### Phase 5: Coverage and Hardening

- improve SDK auto-coverage
- refine filter UX
- validate multi-node chronological behavior
- add retention and load tests

---

## 12. Risks and Tradeoffs

### 12.1 Raw Node Logs Will Still Be Ambiguous

Even after this RFC, raw node logs may still include unrelated activity if a node serves multiple executions. This is acceptable because raw node logs are intentionally not the primary product surface.

### 12.2 Partial Coverage in V1

Fast rollout means:

- some runtime paths may not yet emit structured logs
- some developers will still rely on plain stdout
- perfect correlation may not exist for all user code immediately

This is acceptable as long as the official path is clearly defined and promoted.

### 12.3 Cross-SDK Drift

Without a shared schema and behavior contract, TS, Go, and Python could diverge in:

- field names
- level semantics
- runtime event names
- stdout mirroring behavior

This RFC exists in part to prevent that drift.

### 12.4 Storage Pressure

Execution logs can become high-volume quickly. That is why v1 should prefer:

- short retention
- bounded per-execution limits
- live-first UX

---

## 13. Out of Scope for V1

The following are intentionally excluded from v1:

- raw control-plane server logs on the execution page
- long-term archival observability strategy
- distributed tracing system integration
- tree-grouped or graph-grouped log rendering beyond chronological order
- perfect attribution of arbitrary stdout without structured logger adoption

---

## 14. Implementation Work Breakdown

This work should be split into parallelizable tracks.

### Track A: Architecture and Contracts

1. Finalize structured execution log schema
2. Finalize source, level, and event naming conventions
3. Finalize retention and settings contract

24. Functional tests for concurrent executions on one node
25. Functional tests for fallback behavior when only raw node logs exist
26. Load and retention boundary tests

---

## 15. Acceptance Criteria for V1

V1 is complete when:

- an execution page exposes a primary `Execution Logs` surface
- logs can stream live and fetch a recent tail
- logs are filterable by level, node, source, and text
- SDK/runtime structured logs are stamped with execution identifiers
- key runtime transitions emit automatic system logs
- structured logs can also appear in stdout in local/dev workflows
- raw node logs are available under advanced/debug UI
- lifecycle events remain available as timeline context

---

## 16. Open Questions

These should be resolved before implementation fans out:

1. Should structured execution logs be stored only in the control plane, or also cached locally on nodes for recovery?
2. Should ingestion be per-log-event, batched, or both?
3. How should backpressure behave when a live execution emits logs faster than the control plane can persist them?
4. Should system-generated logs be suppressible per node or per environment?
5. Should the UI visually separate system logs from developer logs by default, or only via filters?

---

## 17. Recommendation

Proceed with this RFC as the coordination artifact for the execution-observability workstream.

Build execution-correlated structured logs as the primary execution-page experience, preserve lifecycle events as timeline anchors, and keep raw node logs as an advanced debug layer. This achieves a useful v1 quickly while preserving a clean path to richer observability later.
