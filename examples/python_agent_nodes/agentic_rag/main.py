"""
Meta-Cognitive Agentic RAG - Self-Reasoning Multi-Agent System

Architecture Philosophy:
- Composed 0.3 LLMs → 0.8 system capability
- No hardcoded rules - AI reasons about requirements dynamically
- Simple schemas (2-4 fields) - One reasoner, one job
- Intelligence emerges from clever composition
- String for reasoning → passed as context
- Structured for decisions → programmatic routing

12-Phase Meta-Cognitive Pipeline:
1. Document chunking
2. Query introspection (AI analyzes query semantics)
3. Precision reasoning (AI decides match requirements)
4. Strategy composition (AI designs retrieval plan)
5. Ensemble retrieval (semantic + keyword + type-specific)
6. Self-aware match quality (AI evaluates WHY chunks matched)
7. Answer synthesis with entity extraction
8. Semantic drift detection (catches entity substitutions)
9. Answer-query alignment verification (final gate)
10. Adaptive confidence calibration (AI-based, not thresholds)
11. Conditional routing (return answer or "no info found")
12. Citation building

Key Innovation: Hallucination Prevention Through Meta-Cognition
- AI detects its own entity mismatches
- "Yann Klegal" ≠ "Yann LeCun" caught by drift detection
- High confidence (0.95) in negative answers when appropriate
